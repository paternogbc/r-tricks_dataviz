This repository is a place to store my list of nice __tricks__ and __useful resources__ for __data vizualition__ in R. I must say that this list is highly biased towards the `ggplot` and `tidyverse` solutions. 

## Core packages

1. [__ggplot2__: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).
2. [__cowplot__: Streamlined Plot Theme and Plot Annotations for 'ggplot2'](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html)

## Additional packages

## Color palettes

## Books

## Tutorials
