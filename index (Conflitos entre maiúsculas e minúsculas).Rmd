This repository is a place to store my list of nice __tricks__ and __useful resources__ for __data vizualition__ in R. I must say that this list is highly biased towards the `ggplot` and `tidyverse` solutions. 

## Main packages

* [__ggplot2__](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/): Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis.  
* [__cowplot__](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/index.html): Streamlined Plot Theme and Plot Annotations for 'ggplot2'

## Color

### Packages

* [__RColorBrewer__](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RColorBrewer/index.html): Provides color schemes for maps (and other graphics) designed by Cynthia Brewer as described at http://colorbrewer2.org.
